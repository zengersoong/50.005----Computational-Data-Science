### Feature Selection and Time Series
Using Sklearn machine learning library for data pre-processing, classification, clustering . 
Using Twitter datasets for sentiment labelling. 4=positive and 0 = negative

1. Machine learning through sklearn . 
2. Data preprocessing and classification . 
3. Using different feature selections to optimise the classifer/ improve results (top - k Features, kNearestNeighbours, top-k percentile) . 
4. Using Weka with package, "Time Series Forecasting" . 
5. Evaluate linear regression with / without attribute(feature) selection.
